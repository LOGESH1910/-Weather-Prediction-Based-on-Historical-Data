# 🌤️ Weather Prediction Based on Historical Data

A machine learning project that predicts future weather conditions using historical weather data. This project utilizes time series analysis and regression techniques to forecast temperature, humidity, rainfall, and other meteorological parameters.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to build an effective and accurate weather prediction model using historical weather datasets. The goal is to demonstrate how data-driven approaches can help anticipate weather conditions, benefiting sectors like agriculture, logistics, and disaster management.

## 🔍 Features

- Load and preprocess historical weather datasets
- Feature engineering and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Machine Learning models for prediction:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for time series forecasting
- Evaluation using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R²
- Visualizations for predictions vs. actual weather
- Easily extendable for other locations or data sources

## 🗃️ Dataset

- Source: [e.g., Kaggle Weather Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- Fields include:
  - Date
  - Temperature (Max/Min)
  - Humidity
  - Rainfall
  - Wind Speed

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras (for LSTM model)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-prediction.git
cd weather-prediction
Run the Project
bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook
Open the notebook weather_prediction.ipynb and follow the steps to run the models.

📈 Model Evaluation
Each model is evaluated using:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)

R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

You can visualize prediction vs actual values with line plots and residual analysis.

📊 Sample Results
Model	MAE	RMSE	R² Score
Linear Regression	2.3°C	3.1°C	0.85
Random Forest	1.7°C	2.4°C	0.91
LSTM	1.4°C	2.1°C	0.93

These results are sample values and may vary depending on the dataset.
